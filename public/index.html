    content="scpwiki is a websites based on SCPS. An SCP it's a entity that breakes the normal laws of physics. Everytime you add one of these entities,
    you can add documents for it. As an example, if you create SCP-102, you will have an entity that in some way can fly, still you don't know how it does,
    even with the best scientists you can't explain why is this SCP-012 flies. And so to keep the world secure you try to capture him and secure him in a facility,
    after that you have now an official SCP captured and contained. Of course this is a website and not a game, but still this is based on one of the games out there!""
